简单来说，中国比澳大利亚要很多的。尤其是一些大型城市，城市的各个维度都不会输给悉尼。

澳大利亚是一个以环境闻名的国家，但是生活不只是只有自然环境。城市的温暖度、人文关怀、以及这座城市离家乡的距离，都应该被纳入到考量范畴内。

并且我终究是想在一个可以说母语的地方生活一生。

以上是从主观角度出发。

从理性角度出发，澳大利亚对华人并不友好。并且根据我在校友会的了解，华人工作者的晋升和最终成就非常受限。并且公共资源在应对社会问题时的对应能力也相对比较差，比如之前有名的澳大利亚大火，这就是政府能力不足的体现，而这更加反映了它们国家体系的问题。

最后，我终究是一个中国人，如果我可以在自己的国家工作，并且保持优秀，那我其实并没有理由把在其他国家工作放到一个优先级更高的位置。

briefly speaking, China is better than Australia. Especially in some large cities, all dimensions of the city will not lose to Sydney.

Australia is a country known for its environment, but life is more than just the natural environment. The warmth of the city, humanistic care, and the distance of the city from home should all be taken into consideration.

And after all, I want to live my whole life in a place where I can speak my mother tongue.

The above is from a subjective point of view.

From a rational point of view, Australia is not friendly to Chinese. And according to my understanding in the alumni association, the promotion and ultimate achievement of Chinese workers are very limited. And the ability of public resources to respond to social problems is relatively poor. For example, the famous Australian fire before, it is a very good evidence the reveal the lackness of the Australian government capacity.

In the end, I am a Chinese after all. If I can work in my own country and threre is no reason to put a higher priority for working abroad.
