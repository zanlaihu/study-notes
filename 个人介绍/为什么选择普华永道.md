普华永道是一家世界知名的企业。像这样的企业可以提供一个非常高的平台，并拢络许多人才，让我得以和最优秀的人在一起工作，一起成长。

这是从公共媒体得到的信息。

那从我个人的第一手资料出发。我在UNSW的时候有一位大我三届的学姐，她入职了普华永道在悉尼的办公室。她给我的反馈是非常建议我去普华永道。

并且在之前的两轮面试中，我也从中感受到了普华永道沟通的方式，我感觉是令人比较舒服的。在之后和HR的沟通中，她也向我说明，两位面试都认为我还是比较不错的。虽然我是一个相对比较自信的人，但是听到这样直观的赞许，其实我还是有一点惊讶的。我感觉不止是我的技术，而是我的性格和特质，在这家公司，是被认可的，或者说是被欢迎的。那在这样一个如鱼得水的环境中，我本身也可以表现的更加好，创造更多的价值。

PricewaterhouseCoopers is a world famous company. Companies like this can provide a very high platform and bring together many talented employees, so that I can work with the best people and grow together.

It is the information obtained from the public media.

That starts from my personal first-hand information. When I was at UNSW, I had a senior sister who worked at PwC's Sydney office. The feedback she gave me was that she strongly suggest me to go to PricewaterhouseCoopers.

And in the previous two rounds of interviews, I also felt that the way how PwC' people communicated was very comfortable. In the later communication with HR, she also told me that both interviews thought I was quite good. Although I am a relatively confident person, I was still a little surprised to hear such direct compliment. I think it is not for just my skills, but my personality and characteristics. I fell like in this company, I am recognized or I can say welcomed. In such an environment like a fish in water, I can perform better and create more value.
