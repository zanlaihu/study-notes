我之前被问到过这个问题，当时我的回答是没有。但是后来我回家以后想了想其实并不是这么回事。

其实目前我在使用的Angular版本是11，11是最新的版本，是整个angular开发团队提供的最符合当下情况的版本。那这个框架本身就是一个前沿的技术。

同时我们在使用的状态管理工具，akita。它基于rxjs制作，并且解决了redux一些繁琐的处理，并且在近些年来正在被越来越多的angular开发者使用，从这个角度来看，它也是一种前沿的技术。

那还有我在开发自己的网站时使用了一个最近刚刚被各大浏览器实现的实验性CSS特性： dropfilter。配合bigsur一起使用，它可以通过CSS原生的就实现毛玻璃的效果。它是最前沿的CSS特性。

还有我在学习React的过程中，看到官方正在主推的React hook，也是前沿的技术。


I was asked this question before by the other interviewers, and my answer was no. But then I thought about it when I got home. It was not like that.

In fact, the Angular version I am currently using is 11. 11 is the latest version, which is the most cutting edge version provided by the entire google team. The framework itself is a cutting-edge technology.

At the mean time, the state management tool we are using, akita. It is based on rxjs and simplyed the complexity of redux. It is being used by more and more angular developers in recent years. From this point of view, it is also a cutting-edge technology.

Then I used an experimental CSS feature that was recently implemented by major browsers when I was developing my personal website: dropfilter. Used with bigsur, it can achieve the effect of frosted glass natively through CSS. There is not doubt that it is most cutting-edge CSS feature.

And during my learning time of React, I found that the official React website promoted a new method called the react hook that was being promoted was also a cutting-edge technology.

Hook is a new feature of React 16.8. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.
