这个问题其实很难。因为我并没有充分地了解这个职业需要担负的具体工作。

我所知道的是这是一个前端开发工程师，在一个国际部门，需要对接东南亚客户。

所以我只能从自身出发，去述说一些我的优点。然后由您来评判我是否可以胜任这个工作。

首先我觉得需要胜任这个岗位重要的两个因素是：
1.沟通能力，与外国人沟通的能力。那么这需要一个基本的英语能力和一个能够快速临场应变的能力
2.技术能力，具有符合阿里需求的基本技术实力

第一点能力我比较有自信，因为我曾经在英国留学一年，在澳大利亚留学两年，并且还在悉尼有过实习经历。见识过各式各样的场景，正能量的场景，比如校友聚会，负能量的场景，比如上法庭。我经历过各式各样的场合，能够做到临危不乱。

第二点，直接点说，我觉得我目前的能力，无法胜任。这并不是我不自信，而是我充分调查后得出的结论。因为我在埃森哲期间使用的技术栈的确不是当前主流技术，我们使用Angular框架，并且使用Akita作为状态管理工具。这些你可能都没有听说过，并且我也知道目前流行的是React和Redux再加上node.js实现的架构。但是不匹配这并不是我的问题，这是埃森哲的问题，是他们选择要使用这样的一个技术架构。所以这不是我个人资质，或者说学习能力的问题，因为我作为一名员工，肯定要满足公司的需求，去学习公司需要的技能。并且在认识到这个问题之后，我也努力做出了改变，我目前已经跳槽到了普华永道，会在下周入职，并且它们使用的都是目前最流行的技术，那我相信经过一年的积累或者自信点说半年，我觉得我将可以匹配一线互联网公司的需求。

This question is actually quite difficult. Because I didn't fully understand the specific demands of this position.

All I know is that it is a front-end development engineer who needs to connect with Southeast Asian customers in an international department.

So I can only start from myself and talk about some of my strengths. Then it is up to you to judge whether I am qualified for this job.

First of all, I think the two important factors that need to be qualified for this position are:
1. Communication skills, the ability to communicate with foreigners, which requires a basic English ability and an ability to respond quickly on the spot
2. Technical ability, with basic technical knowledges that meets Ali's needs

I am more confident of the first one , because I have studied in the UK for one year, studied in Australia for two years, and also had an internship experience in Sydney. I have seen through many kinds of scenes, positive energy scenes, such as alumni gatherings, negative energy scenes, such as talking to a laywer. I have experienced enough kinds of occasions to meet this ability.

The second point, to be honest, I don't think my current ability is competent this role. This is not because I am not confident, and it is just for now. Because the technology stack I used during Accenture is not satisfied for the current mainstream technology, we use the Angular framework and Akita as a state management tool. You may even not heard of these, and I also know that the current popular ones are React and Redux plus node.js. But the mismatch is not my fault. It is Accenture’s choice. And after recognizing this problem, I have also studied hard to make changes. I will join the PWC company the next week, and they use the most popular technology at the moment. Then I believe that after a year or maybe just six months , I will be able to match the needs of first-line Internet companies.
