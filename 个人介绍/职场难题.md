我觉得让我感觉最心烦的是一件责任划分导致的问题。

首先要说明一下我们团队的管理模式，每一个案件都有一张对应的票，根据每一张票的内容去完成任务。所以 no ticket no work。

项目人员每个月会进行一次微调。在一次调整后，我们组进来了一个新同事。他当时被分到了一张票，需要同时做好需求分析设计书和开发。但是他对于目前我们这个团队的技术并不熟悉，所以组长就让我去帮助一下他，我也去帮助他了，但是帮到后面，开发的部分一直都是我在做，他就说认为需求有问题，一直在修改设计书。而这个帮助其实是义务性，因为票还是署他的名字，同时我自己本身也是有工作需要对应的。

那导致的结果就是，这张票的进度非常慢。项目经理就去找他问话了，而他则把原因怪到我的速度慢。

一般来说项目经理会重视每个组的任务进度，但细节到每一个员工是比较困难的。所以我决定先跟我的组长说清楚这件事。

好在 IT 项目，每一行代码后面都是会显示名字，他没有做开发自然也就没有留下任何痕迹。所以组长最后把这张票切成两张，一张做设计，一张做开发，开发的票重新规划作业时间，然后分配到我身上。

I think what bothers me most is a problem caused by the division of responsibilities.

In our team, each task has a corresponding ticket. So let's say no ticket no work.

The project team members are adjusted slightly once a month. After an adjustment, a new colleague came into our my. And he was assigned a ticket to do requirements analysis, design document and coding. However, he is not familiar with the current technology stack, so my leader asked me to help him, and I did as him asked. However, when the things goes on, it turns out that I am the only one do the development part. This new colleague just keep doing analysis and analysis.

which lead to a very slow progress of this ticket. The project manager questioned him, this college blamed my slow speed.

That is the time I decided to make it clear to my team leader.

Fortunately, for an IT project, each line of code has an history to track. He did nothing, so he left nothing in the code history. Then the direct leader cut this ticket into two parts, one for design and one for development. The development ticket was assigned to me and the operation time of it was rescheduled.

And this is the whole story of it.
