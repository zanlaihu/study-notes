# 个人介绍

我叫胡赞来。硕士毕业于新南威尔士大学，信息技术专业。我的本科毕业于浙江师范大学，软件工程专业。

毕业后我回国来到埃森哲作为软件工程师开启我的职业生涯。

我在里面担任前端开发的工作。

两个项目使用的技术栈都是 angular+spring boot 的前后端分离设计思路。

目前刚刚跳槽，将会于下周入职普华永道。

Self introduction
My name is Hu Zanlai and I was graduated from the University of New South Wales majored in information technology. My bachelor degree was got from Zhejiang Normal University, majored in software engineering.

After graduation, I just returned and start my career. Working as an software engineer in Accenture was my first official job.

During my working time in Accenture, I participated in two projects. Both of the projects use Angular as the main structure for the front-end.

I quit this job last week and will join PWC to start my next journey.

And that's all, thank you.

# 优势

I think one of my strength is my strong learning ability. I mastered the basic knowledge of angular only in one week and then I can participate in the coding process.

The second is that I have fully control my part of this project, and give my leader a sense of security. Well, it's not something like I can do everything or anything. It's the ability to know exactly what I can do and how much time I would have to spend on this part. And let my leader clearly control the schedule. And I always report the necessary information asap.

My manager likes my working style，she thinks it really do some help for managing time schedule and make her feel safe. That's why I got the authority to review the new employees' codes which is unusual for a person who just graduated and worked for one year.

My disadvantage is that sometimes for strangers, I am a little shy and nervous at the beginning, but I can hide this emotion.
