# 个人介绍

我叫胡赞来。硕士毕业于新南威尔士大学，信息技术专业。我的本科毕业于浙江师范大学，软件工程专业。

毕业后我回国来到埃森哲作为软件工程师开启我的职业生涯。

入职后进入的第一个项目是为一家日本大型保险公司开发的车辆保险项目。我在里面担任了软件设计、前端开发和后端开发的工作。

在去年 12 月时进入当前项目，是一个为日本银行开发的在线小额贷款项目。我在
里面担任前端开发的工作。

两个项目使用的技术栈都是 angular+spring boot 的前后端分离设计思路。

我接触前端开发的时间，算上实习和正式工作一共是 16 个月。

目前还未接触前端上一些技术，把工作之余的重心放在学习《JavaScript 红宝书》和《精通 CSS 高级程序设计》这两本书上，一边看一边把知识点总结成笔记。

> 目前在简历上没有放前端相关的开源项目。但是放了一个之前做的聊天机器人项目，因为我感觉它可以侧面反映我的软件开发素养。

Self introduction
My name is Hu Zanlai and I was graduated from the University of New South Wales majored in information technology. My bachelor degree was got from Zhejiang Normal University, majored in software engineering.

After graduation, I return to my country to start my career. Working as an software engineer in Accenture was my first official job.

During my working time in Accenture, I participated in two projects. The first is a car insurance project. The second one, which is also the project I am currently working on. It is porject for the persoanl leading of money. Both of the projects use Angular as the main strcture for the front-end.

In these two projects, I mainly responsible for the front-end. My duty is to communicate and decide how to develop functions to satisfy the demand.

I think one of my strength is my strong learning ability. I mastered the basic knowledge of angular only in half a month and then I can participate in the coding process. And I reached a professional stage of it in the next few months.

The second but not least is that I can really master my job or I say fully control the responsible part of this project, and give my leader and colleges a sense of security. Well, it's not something like I can do everything or anything. It's the power to know exactly what I can do and how much time I would have to spend on this part. And tell me leader whenever there is something I have to report. So I can always reach my goal before the deadline. And I got extra time to make it better.

My manager likes my working style，she thinks it really do some help for managing time schedule and make her feel safe. That's why I got the authority to review the new employees' codes which is unusual for a person who just graduated from the unversity and worked for one year.

This is all my self-introduction, thank you for your listening.

My disadvantage is that sometimes for strangers, I am a little shy and nervous at the beginning, but I can hide this emotion.

# 你为什么会想要跳槽

I guess, sorry, I think the most important reason is that I wish to work for a first party company.
