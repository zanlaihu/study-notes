# 个人介绍

我的名字是胡赞来。

硕士毕业于新南威尔士大学，信息技术专业

本科毕业于浙江师范大学，软件工程专业

毕业后的第一份正式工作是埃森哲的软件工程师。

入职后进入的第一个项目是为一家日本大型保险公司开发的车辆保险项目。我在里面担任了软件设计、前端开发和后端开发的工作。

在去年 12 月时进入当前项目，是一个为日本银行开发的在线小额贷款项目。我在
里面担任前端开发的工作。

两个项目使用的技术栈都是 angular+spring boot 的前后端分离设计思路。

我接触前端开发的时间，算上实习和正式工作一共是 16 个月。

目前还未接触前端上一些技术，把工作之余的重心放在学习《JavaScript 红宝书》和《精通 CSS 高级程序设计》这两本书上，一边看一边把知识点总结成笔记。

> 目前在简历上没有放前端相关的开源项目。但是放了一个之前做的聊天机器人项目，因为我感觉它可以侧面反映我的软件开发素养。

Self introduction
My name is Hu Zanlai and I was graduated from the University of New South Wales with a major in information technology. I got my bachelor degree from Zhejiang Normal University, majoring in software engineering.

After graduation, I chose to return to China to continue my future. So I Joined Accenture in May last year as a software engineer.

During my work at Accenture, I had two projects in total. The first is called EDSP, which is a car insurance project. I am mainly responsible for payment and refund functions

I Entered the second project in November last year, which is also the project I am currently working on. It is called promise, which is an online small personal loan project.

In these two projects, I mainly responsible for front-end development. Apart from this, I have also done back-end development and testing related work.

The main technology is angular and spring boot

I think my strength is my strong learning ability. I mastered the basic knowledge of angular only in half a month and can participate in the coding process. And I reached a professional stage of it in the next few months.

So was the studying of spring boot

This is all my self-ingtroduction,thank you

My disadvantage is that sometimes for strangers, I am a little shy and nervous at the beginning, but I can hide this emotion from the other person.
